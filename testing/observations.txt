 ================= THOSE ARE ONLY  OBSERVATIONS FROM MY EARLY TESTING ON MY SAMPLES ===========
 
noticed the following : 

0) size on disk property on windows  show 0 byte size for files smaller than 1kb (using win 10 - dec 2022)
1) editng signature of bmp file emidiatlly corrupts it

2)missing with allignment "padding" in (pixles data section) emidiatlly currupts it

3) appending to end of the bmp file i.e."pixels data section" will have no effect. only will increase actuall size of file .

4) changing height and width variables in header :
 a) increasing width or height  without adding the new pixels will corrupt it 
 b) decreasing width will work even if u dont set padding bytes to zero (will just ignore them)
 note : still need to test 4.b further to see if sometimes it could corrupt the file
 c) decreasing height will keep bmp working but the image will change ( the pixels  at end of file  will be  discarded)
 note : pixels data at end will be the first rows from top in a shown image on the screen (or first rows in index in cv2 python)
 note : although image totally altered by changing those 2 variables , actuall size  still same on win and cv2 pyhton lib 
 
5) increasing/decreasing  the total size or pixles sections size variables in header will not corrupt the file 
and cv2 library in python for instance will stay read the actual pixles size 

 
 6) "DIB size" , "image section size" and "total size"  variables in header are merely for programmer use/refrence and file structur.
    neither windows nor cv2 depend on them .
 note : (try set 3 of them to zero and save : image will run unchanged / size form propreties will not change / size on cv2 python will not change
 
 7) so conclude that the most 3 crucial variables are : file signature , width in pxl , height in pxl.
 note : only deleting actuall bytes from file will change the size on windows and cv2 python lib
