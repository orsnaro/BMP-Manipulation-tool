code
--> opens vs code

ctrl +c   OR   q
----> terminate current operation

$t
----> seperate mutliple commands in alias

git rebase -i head~(number of commits before current that you want to delete)
--> will open an editor jsut put 'd' before any commit u want to delete
--> after that save and close editor 

git push -f to final update the commit histroy at remote

################ (CMD & power shell) ############# IMPORTANT only

help <ur command> 
or <ur command> /? 
or <ur command>  --help
--> to read documentaion for the command u want (last one for cmder and linux only)

to use help in cmd 

*note:  using '/' or '\' is interchangable in cmd -most if time- also 'tab' will autocomplete ur command

--> opens vs code

start filename.exe 
--> (open any exe in directory)

start/min filename.exe 
--> (start any exe minimized)

command |clip   OR    clip <filename.txt
---> copy terminal  or any .txt to clip board

type nul > filename.txt
---> to make new .txt file
---> to write to file use (@echo ur text >> filename.txt) '>>' to append in new line not to overwrite

'cd .\folder1\folder2'                 
 --> change directory to a one inside ur current directory (dont miss dot in begining)

'cd C:\folder1\folder2'              
 --> change directory to a totally different one (u need to type full path starting from partition letter )

'cd ..'                              
  --> go back in directory only one location ( too location would be 'cd ..\..')

CHDIR /d  drive: path
--> (to change to another partion or drive)

'mkdir .\foldername'                   
--> make new folder inside current directory

'Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder1' 
--> removes the folder but it must be empty (to force remove append -recurse)

'New-Item filename.txt -ItemType file'                            
--> make a new file (u can make it .cpp and it will open in txt normally)

'New-Item filename.txt -path [UR FULL PATH HERE] -ItemType file'  
--> make a new file in another dir (u can make it .cpp and it will open in txt normally)

1..5 | foreach { new-item "FILENAME$_.txt" }
--> ***POWER SHELL ONLY!*** --> make multiple new files -5 in this example -  (1st file = FILENAME1 2nd  file= FILENAME2 ...)(make sure to apend by '$_' and if any thing comes after it put space between them)

1..5 | foreach { new-item -path [UR FULL PATH] }
-->multiple files in another dir (u can make an file typ like .cpp) ***POWER SHELL ONLY!***

'get-childitem'                         
--> will list all content -files and folders- inside current directory 

'g++ filname.cpp -o filename.exe' ; .\filename.exe'
--> ***POWER SHELL ONLY!*** (compile and run filname.exe in one statement)(filename.exe could be written only filename)
--> to do same in cmd in one command use '&&' instead of ';' (.\filename --> here'\' is NOT interchangable with '/')

'g++ -c filname.cpp -o filename.exe' ; .\filename.exe'
---> '-c' to just only compile filname not link it (output file is filename.o)

'notepad'
