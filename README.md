# __24-bit Bmp File Manipulation Project__ 

##### This project is made without any libraries except the STD C++17 libs , yes it was a journey!  from learning to deal with hex dump and .bin files to image processing and then gui using QT(soon)ðŸ’™.

> ### ðŸ“£ Beta (v1.5) is out!
 * now can thershhold an image 
 * now can grayscale an image 
 * ~~some bugs fixed~~

</br>

> ###  ðŸ›  Issues &  Notes:

* if using lib *`"filesystem"`* produces errors please try newer cpp compiler version or replace it with [ghc/filesystem](https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem/releases) and replace all instances to *`ghc::filesystem`*
  - <sub>  _**as far as i know**_ : this happends due to *stdc++* not supporting this lib for versions older than *C++17*. </sub>
  * <sub> replacing with `ghc/filesystem` is straight forward :  **download -> then -> `#include "abs-path-to-ghc/filesystem.h"`** . </sub>

* Due to some Dependency/dynamic linking issues i provided a static linked .exe  to use. This will work almost for all platforms
  - [cross_platform_bmp_betav1.5.exe](https://github.com/orsnaro/Static_chroma_bmp/blob/master/cross_platform_bmp_betav1.5.exe) .
  * <sub> to produce it when compiling my source code use command `g++ main.cpp -o chorma_proj.exe -static-libstdc++` .</sub>

<sub>At full release this repo will be a mini-gui-application on (file streaming in cpp  + image manipulation)  , Note : I know it's much easier in e.g.(python). but I need it.   its  mainly for  educational purposes .
