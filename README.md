# __24-bit Bmp File Manipulation Project__ 

##### This project is made without any libraries except the STD C++ libs , yes it was a journey!  from learning to deal with hex dump and .bin files to image processing and then gui using QT(soon)  + making the new feature of static chroma replace isha (soon)ðŸ’™.

> ### Bete version (v1.5) is out!
 * now can thershhold an image 
 * now can grayscale an image 
 * ~~some bugs fixed~~

<sub>At full release this repo will be a mini-gui-application on (file streaming in cpp  + image manipulation)  , Note : I know it's much easier in python. but I need it in   its  for mainly educational purposes . </sub>
